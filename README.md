## Overview

MiniGPT is a clean, educational implementation of a GPT-style transformer language model built entirely from scratch using PyTorch.

The implementation includes:
- Complete transformer architecture with multi-head self-attention
- Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenization
- Comprehensive training pipeline with checkpoint management
- Interactive inference modes for text generation
- Model analysis and inspection tools

## Project Philosophy

### AI Belongs to Everyone

**Artificial intelligence is not property—it is knowledge, and knowledge must be free.**

In an era where AI systems increasingly influence every aspect of human life, from education to healthcare, from creative expression to scientific discovery, the concentration of AI capabilities in the hands of a few organizations represents a fundamental threat to human autonomy and progress.

This project is built on several core principles:

**1. Transparency Over Obscurity**
- No individual, corporation, or institution has the right to monopolize artificial intelligence
- The inner workings of AI systems should be open to inspection, understanding, and critique
- Closed-source AI perpetuates information asymmetry and concentrates power

**2. Access Over Gatekeeping**
- Every person should have the ability to create, modify, and deploy their own AI systems
- Educational barriers should be lowered, not raised
- Economic barriers should not determine who can participate in the AI revolution

**3. Knowledge Over Control**
- Understanding how AI works is a human right in the 21st century
- Open implementations enable researchers, students, and developers worldwide to learn and innovate
- Collaborative development produces more robust, ethical, and beneficial AI systems

**4. Democratization Over Centralization**
- AI that serves humanity must be developed by humanity—not just by a handful of tech giants
- Diverse perspectives in AI development lead to fairer, more representative systems
- Open-source AI prevents any single entity from controlling this transformative technology

MiniGPT proves that you don't need billions of dollars or proprietary datasets to understand and build language models. With this implementation, anyone can:
- Study how transformers actually work under the hood
- Train custom models on their own data
- Experiment with architectural modifications
- Deploy AI without vendor lock-in or API dependencies

**This is AI for the people, by the people.**

## Usage

### Training a Model

#### 1. Prepare Your Data

Create a `data/` folder and add your text files (`.txt` format):

```bash
mkdir data
# Add your .txt files to the data/ folder
```

#### 2. Configure Training Parameters

Edit `train.py` to set your hyperparameters:

```python
# Model Architecture
embed_dim = 128        # Embedding dimension
num_heads = 4          # Number of attention heads
num_layers = 2         # Number of transformer layers
max_seq_len = 128      # Maximum sequence length

# Training Configuration
batch_size = 8         # Batch size
epochs = 1000          # Number of training epochs
lr = 2e-4              # Learning rate
save_every = 200       # Save checkpoint every N epochs

# Paths
data_folder = "data"   # Folder containing training data
save_dir = "models"    # Directory to save models
```

#### 3. Start Training

```bash
python train.py
```

The script will:
- Train a BPE tokenizer on your data
- Initialize the model architecture
- Train with automatic checkpoint saving
- Resume from the latest checkpoint if interrupted

**Output:**
```
🔹 No copies are saved, start from the beginning
Epoch 0 | Loss: 8.5234
Epoch 50 | Loss: 6.2341
Epoch 100 | Loss: 4.8912
...
🔹 The model has been saved in models/minigpt_model.pt
```

   Enter folder number to enter (or 'quit' to exit):
   ```

2. **Select Model File:**
   ```
   [*] Models in folder 'models':
   1. final_model.pt
   2. minigpt_model.pt
   Enter model number to load (or 'back' to go back):
   ```

3. **Choose Interaction Mode:**
   ```
   Select mode:
   1. Auto-generate text (press Enter to generate)
   2. Chat with model (enter prompts)
   Type 'back' to select another model or 'quit' to exit.
   ```

#### Mode 1: Auto-Generation

Press Enter to generate random text samples:

```
[TEXT] Generated text:
The model generates creative text based on its training...
```

#### Mode 2: Chat Mode

Have a conversation with your model:

```
You: Hello, how are you?
Model: I'm doing well, thank you for asking...

You: Tell me about artificial intelligence
Model: Artificial intelligence refers to...
```

## Technical Details

### Attention Mechanism

The self-attention mechanism computes attention scores as:

```
Attention(Q, K, V) = softmax(QK^T / √d_k) V
```

With causal masking to prevent attending to future tokens:

```python
mask = torch.tril(torch.ones(T, T))
scores = scores.masked_fill(mask == 0, float('-inf'))
```

### Training Objective

Cross-entropy loss for next-token prediction:

```python
loss = CrossEntropyLoss(logits, targets)
```

### Tokenization

BPE tokenizer with special tokens:
- `<pad>`: Padding token
- `<unk>`: Unknown token
- `<|user|>`: User message marker
- `<|assistant|>`: Assistant message marker
- `<|end|>`: End of generation

### Checkpoint Format

Saved checkpoints include:
```python
{
    "model_state_dict": model.state_dict(),
    "optimizer_state_dict": optimizer.state_dict(),
    "epoch": current_epoch,
    "vocab": tokenizer_vocabulary,
    "config": {
        "embed_dim": 128,
        "num_heads": 4,
        "num_layers": 2,
        "max_seq_len": 128
    }
}
```

## Best Practices

### For Training

1. **Data Quality**: Use clean, well-formatted text data
2. **Vocabulary Size**: Balance between coverage and efficiency (3000-10000 tokens)
3. **Sequence Length**: Match to your use case (128 for chat, 512+ for documents)
4. **Learning Rate**: Start with 1e-4 to 5e-4, adjust based on loss curves
5. **Checkpointing**: Save frequently to prevent data loss

### For Inference

1. **Temperature**: Use 0.7-0.9 for coherent text, 1.0-1.5 for creative text
2. **Prompt Engineering**: Provide clear, well-formatted prompts
3. **Max Length**: Set appropriate limits to prevent runaway generation
4. **Model Selection**: Use well-trained checkpoints (higher epoch counts)

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. CUDA Out of Memory**
```python
# Reduce batch size in train.py
batch_size = 4  # or lower
```

**2. Poor Text Quality**
- Train for more epochs
- Increase model size (embed_dim, num_layers)
- Use more/better training data
- Adjust temperature during generation

**3. Slow Training**
- Verify GPU is being used: `torch.cuda.is_available()`
- Reduce max_seq_len
- Use mixed precision training (advanced)

**4. Tokenizer Errors**
- Ensure tokenizer.json is in the same folder as model .pt files
- Retrain tokenizer if vocabulary is corrupted
